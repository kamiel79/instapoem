# instapoem

Takes a text *poem* and turns it into an Instagram square PNG (612 x 612 px)

## Usage

Create `env/env.py` with the following:

* username = "" 	#your Instagram username
* password = ""	#your Instagram password
* FLICKRKEY = "yourkey"   #if you want the script to grab a flickr image using the title as keyword
* FLICKRSECRET = "yoursecret"



I am new to this (my computer science Master's is 20 years old) so any seasonend developer out there pointing me in the right direction will be much appreciated!

Take care!
