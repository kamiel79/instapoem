Anarchism

I speed read a book on anarchism
A typographical error by one anarchist
is quoted by another. Sic! My coffee is hot
I think of anarchy in Guatemala. Are they still selling
their coffee to a god who comes in a steel vessel?
A god who brings them smartphones? I think about
Seattle and Kropotkin, speed read to Proudhon and Malateste
because anarchism is speed. You kill, and you cut the meat.
