Bird
Oh beguiling creature, I will observe you quietly
without the desire to know your scientific name, or how many
there are of you. I will follow you in your flight, I will look
at the color of your feathers, or at the mournful bend of your beak,Â 
and call you that. I will listen to your song, hidden
in the sound of the woods.
