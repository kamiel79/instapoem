After Twenty Years I Found My Violin Teacher

After twenty years I found my violin teacher
on Facebook. She remembered me, that was one of the joys of teaching, she wrote.

In the mean time, entire lives have started:
our children born, nine eleven, financial crisis. History has happened.

I want to ask her about my vibrato.
