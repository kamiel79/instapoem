Raven

O black hunter of the endless skies
Strong bird with the night in your eyes

They say you are a harbinger of bad luck
That your dark feathers spell disaster

But when I hear your croaking voice
It is like hearing the laughter of a tree 

I realize how much nature desires
To be sung of, and I celebrate thee
