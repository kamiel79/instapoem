beyond recognition 

I do what they tell me to
a janitor in their symbolic universe
an abstract place that I hate, hate
because they got me good
I am writing the story of a .. 
not even an enemy. I slave for it
my own meaning grows negative
defined by their emptiness
is it no more than a scar
in the crack of death
