Canned Food

That day the rooster missed the sunrise
a strangeness sat on the world
White birds are counting each other's autographs
because the horizon smells of burnt rubber
A well-kempt general does the narration:
next week they will pull in the moon
I nod sullenly on my perch, his eyes are gray like ash.
